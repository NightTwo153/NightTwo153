Hi, I'm NightTwo 👋
I'm a passionate self-taught developer with experience in several programming languages ​​such as Java, C++, and some Python. Currently, I'm focusing on the world of Linux and learning about web development independently. My curiosity about technology has led me to explore 3D character development as well, and I've created small video game projects and mods for games, mostly to enjoy with my friends and as part of my learning process.

The inspiration to delve into the world of game development and programming came from my love for some video games that marked my childhood.

My projects range from simple apps to mods and tools for games, and I love sharing my progress with the community. In the future, I'll be adding open source projects to my profile, so feel free to follow me and check them out!
